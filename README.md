# Mutual Growth for College Coders

**DevCircle** is an open-source platform designed to boost coding communities *within colleges* through fair and active peer-to-peer support. Instead of fighting for visibility on crowded global platforms, SwapUp creates a focused, trust-based space where developers help each other — and grow together.

- ✅ Request help (code review, bug fix, GitHub star, project collab)
- ✅ Earn help credits by helping others
- ✅ Connect only with active users in your college
- ✅ Build your college's dev culture with no spam, no noise
